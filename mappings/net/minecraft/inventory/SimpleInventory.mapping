CLASS net/minecraft/class_1277 net/minecraft/inventory/SimpleInventory
	COMMENT A generic implementation of {@link Inventory}. This is used in a number of
	COMMENT places, mostly:
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <ul>
	COMMENT <li>To store the input of a {@link net.minecraft.screen.ScreenHandler} while
	COMMENT it is open. The inventory is stored as a field, and the screen handler will have
	COMMENT a slot backed by that inventory.</li>
	COMMENT <li>When defining the clientside constructor for a {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.screen.ScreenHandler} subclass. The contents of the inventory will
	COMMENT then be automatically synced from the serverside screen handler, which queries
	COMMENT the original inventory.</li>
	COMMENT <li>For entities and block entities which do not interact with hoppers and therefore
	COMMENT do not need to implement {@link Inventory} themselves.
	COMMENT </ul>
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Changes to the inventory can be listened to either by subclassing this and
	COMMENT overriding {@link #markDirty}, or by using {@link #addListener}.
