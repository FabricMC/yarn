CLASS net/minecraft/class_3248 net/minecraft/server/network/ServerLoginNetworkHandler
	COMMENT The server login network handler.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>It listens to packets on the netty event loop and is ticked on the
	COMMENT server thread simultaneously.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT @implSpec The vanilla implementation is created by a handshake network
	COMMENT handler. It first receives a hello packet from the client. If it is in
	COMMENT {@linkplain MinecraftServer#isOnlineMode() online mode}, it goes through
	COMMENT an additional authentication process. Then it optionally sends a network
	COMMENT compression packet. Finally, when it can accept the player (no player
	COMMENT UUID conflicts), it will accept the player by sending a login success
	COMMENT packet and then transitions the connection's packet listener to a {@link
	COMMENT ServerPlayNetworkHandler}.
