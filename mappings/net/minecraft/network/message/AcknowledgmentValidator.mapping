CLASS net/minecraft/class_7638 net/minecraft/network/message/AcknowledgmentValidator
	COMMENT A class that validates the clients' message acknowledgment.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>When clients receive or send messages, they send "acknowledgments" to the server,
	COMMENT containing messages they've last seen or received. If there are too many messages
	COMMENT waiting for message acknowledgments (more than {@value
	COMMENT net.minecraft.server.network.ServerPlayNetworkHandler#MAX_PENDING_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}),
	COMMENT or if the acknowledgment is incorrect, the client will be disconnected.

	METHOD method_44988 order (Ljava/util/List;[ILnet/minecraft/class_7635$class_7609;)I
		COMMENT Orders {@code lastSeen}. {@code result} should be an array with the same size
		COMMENT as {@code lastSeen}, and it will hold the order of each entry, where a larger
		COMMENT integer corresponds to more recent message. If the integer is {@value #UNKNOWN},
		COMMENT then the message is unknown (neither previously acknowledged nor is newly sent),
		COMMENT which causes validation failure.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @return the order of the last received message; if any messages have higher order
		COMMENT than this, it is a validation failure.
