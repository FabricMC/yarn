CLASS net/minecraft/class_7492 net/minecraft/network/message/ChatDecorator
	COMMENT Chat decorator decorates the chat server-side. Currently, only one chat decorator
	COMMENT can exist at a time. The chat decorator that is currently used can be obtained by
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer#getChatDecorator}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>For the chat decorator to produce a signed message, <strong>both the server
	COMMENT and the sender's client need to have chat previews enabled</strong>, Otherwise, the decorated
	COMMENT content is considered unsigned, and if the clients require chat messages to be signed
	COMMENT via the {@linkplain net.minecraft.client.option.GameOptions#getOnlyShowSignedChat
	COMMENT "Only Show Signed Chat" option}, they will see the undecorated message. Therefore,
	COMMENT chat decorator is <strong>not recommended for censoring messages</strong>.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>It is <strong>very important that the decorator return the same text when previewed
	COMMENT and sent</strong>. If this is not followed correctly, the server detects that the client
	COMMENT sent a forged text and discards the message. For example, a decorator that appends the
	COMMENT time the decoration was applied would be likely to fail, since there is usually a delay
	COMMENT between the previewing and the submission. One way to solve this issue is to make it
	COMMENT cache the result on preview, so that when the sent message needs decorating, the cached
	COMMENT value can be used.
