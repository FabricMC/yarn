CLASS net/minecraft/class_7492 net/minecraft/network/message/MessageDecorator
	COMMENT Message decorator decorates the chat messages and other messages server-side.
	COMMENT Currently, only one message decorator can exist at a time. The message decorator
	COMMENT that is currently used can be obtained by
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer#getMessageDecorator}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>For the message decorator to produce a signed message, <strong>both the server
	COMMENT and the sender's client need to have chat previews enabled</strong>, Otherwise, the decorated
	COMMENT content is considered unsigned, and if the clients require chat messages to be signed
	COMMENT via the {@linkplain net.minecraft.client.option.GameOptions#getOnlyShowSecureChat
	COMMENT "Only Show Secure Chat" option}, they will see the undecorated message. Therefore,
	COMMENT message decorator is <strong>not recommended for censoring messages</strong>.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>It is <strong>very important that the decorator be pure; i.e. return the
	COMMENT same text when given the same text (and sender)</strong>. Otherwise, the server
	COMMENT detects a mismatch between the preview and the actual message, and discards the message
	COMMENT as it is now considered improperly signed. For example, a decorator that appends
	COMMENT the time the decoration was applied would be likely to fail, since there is usually
	COMMENT a delay between the previewing and the submission.
	FIELD field_39384 NOOP Lnet/minecraft/class_7492;
		COMMENT An empty message decorator that returns the original message.
	METHOD decorate (Lnet/minecraft/class_3222;Lnet/minecraft/class_2561;)Ljava/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture;
		COMMENT {@return the decorated {@code message}}
		ARG 1 sender
			COMMENT the player who sent the message, or {@code null} if {@code message} was not
			COMMENT sent by a player
		ARG 2 message
	METHOD decorateFiltered (Lnet/minecraft/class_3222;Lnet/minecraft/class_5837;)Ljava/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture;
		COMMENT {@return the decorated filtered message from undecorated {@code message}}
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This keeps the filtered status of the original message; i.e. fully censored messages
		COMMENT will remain fully censored, and unfiltered messages will remain unfiltered. If the message
		COMMENT is partially filtered, both the raw and the filtered message will be decorated.
