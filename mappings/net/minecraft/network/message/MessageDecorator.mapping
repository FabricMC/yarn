CLASS net/minecraft/class_7492 net/minecraft/network/message/MessageDecorator
	COMMENT Message decorator decorates the chat messages and other messages server-side.
	COMMENT Currently, only one message decorator can exist at a time. The message decorator
	COMMENT that is currently used can be obtained by
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer#getMessageDecorator}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>For the message decorator to produce a signed message, <strong>both the server
	COMMENT and the sender's client need to have chat previews enabled</strong>, Otherwise, the decorated
	COMMENT content is considered unsigned, and if the clients require chat messages to be signed
	COMMENT via the {@linkplain net.minecraft.client.option.GameOptions#getOnlyShowSecureChat
	COMMENT "Only Show Secure Chat" option}, they will see the undecorated message. Therefore,
	COMMENT message decorator is <strong>not recommended for censoring messages</strong>.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>It is <strong>very important that the decorator be pure; i.e. return the
	COMMENT same text when given the same text (and sender)</strong>. Otherwise, the server
	COMMENT detects a mismatch between the preview and the actual message, and discards the message
	COMMENT as it is now considered improperly signed. For example, a decorator that appends
	COMMENT the time the decoration was applied would be likely to fail, since there is usually
	COMMENT a delay between the previewing and the submission.
