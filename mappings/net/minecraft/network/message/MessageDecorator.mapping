CLASS net/minecraft/class_7492 net/minecraft/network/message/MessageDecorator
	COMMENT Message decorator decorates the chat messages and other messages server-side.
	COMMENT Currently, only one message decorator can exist at a time. The message decorator
	COMMENT that is currently used can be obtained by
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer#getMessageDecorator}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>For the message decorator to produce a signed message, <strong>both the server
	COMMENT and the sender's client need to have chat previews enabled</strong>, Otherwise, the decorated
	COMMENT content is considered unsigned, and if the clients require chat messages to be signed
	COMMENT via the {@linkplain net.minecraft.client.option.GameOptions#getOnlyShowSecureChat
	COMMENT "Only Show Secure Chat" option}, they will see the undecorated message. Therefore,
	COMMENT message decorator is <strong>not recommended for censoring messages</strong>.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Message decorator results are {@linkplain CachedDecoratorResult cached}, allowing
	COMMENT non-pure decorators (i.e. ones affected by externally controlled variables) without
	COMMENT affecting the signature verification process. Note that the decorator can still
	COMMENT run during message submission to decorate filtered parts of the message.
	FIELD field_39384 NOOP Lnet/minecraft/class_7492;
		COMMENT An empty message decorator that returns the original message.
