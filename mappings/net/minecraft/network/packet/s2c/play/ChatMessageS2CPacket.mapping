CLASS net/minecraft/class_7438 net/minecraft/network/packet/s2c/play/ChatMessageS2CPacket
	COMMENT A packet used to send a chat message to the clients.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The content is not wrapped in any way (e.g. by {@code chat.type.text} text); the
	COMMENT raw message content is sent to the clients, and they will wrap it. To register
	COMMENT custom wrapping behaviors, check {@link MessageType#register}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Chat messages have signatures. It is possible to use a bogus signature - such as
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.network.message.MessageSignature#none} - to send a chat
	COMMENT message; however if the signature is invalid (e.g. because the text's content differs
	COMMENT from the one sent by the client, or because the passed signature is invalid) the client
	COMMENT will show a warning and can discard it depending on the options. See {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.network.message.MessageSignature#updateSignature} for how the
	COMMENT message is signed.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>If the message takes more than {@link SignedMessage#CLIENTBOUND_TIME_TO_LIVE}
	COMMENT to reach the clients (including the time it originally took to reach the server),
	COMMENT the message is not considered secure anymore by the clients, and may be discarded
	COMMENT depending on the clients' options.
