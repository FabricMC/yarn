CLASS net/minecraft/class_7438 net/minecraft/network/packet/s2c/play/ChatMessageS2CPacket
	COMMENT A packet used to send a chat message to the clients.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The content is not wrapped in any way (e.g. by {@code chat.type.text} text); the
	COMMENT raw message content is sent to the clients, and they will wrap it. To register
	COMMENT custom wrapping behaviors, check {@link MessageType#register}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Messages that took more than {@link #TIME_TO_LIVE} to reach the clients are
	COMMENT considered expired. This is measured from the time the client sent the chat message
	COMMENT to the server. Note that unlike {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.network.packet.c2s.play.ChatMessageC2SPacket} expired messages are not
	COMMENT discarded by the clients; they instead log a warning.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Chat messages have signatures. It is possible to use a bogus signature - such as
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.network.message.MessageSignature#none} - to send a chat
	COMMENT message; however if the signature is invalid (e.g. because the text's content differs
	COMMENT from the one sent by the client, or because the passed signature is invalid) the client
	COMMENT will log a warning. See {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.network.message.MessageSignature#updateSignature} for how the
	COMMENT message is signed.
