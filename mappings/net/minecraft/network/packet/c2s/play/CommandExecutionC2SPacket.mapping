	COMMENT A packet used to execute commands on the server.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This truncates the command to at most 256 characters before sending to the
	COMMENT server on the client. If the server receives the command longer than 256 characters,
	COMMENT it will reject the message and disconnect the client.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>If the command contains an invalid character (see {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.SharedConstants#isValidChar}) or if the server receives
	COMMENT the commands in improper order, the server will reject the command and disconnect
	COMMENT the client.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Commands that took more than {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.network.message.SignedMessage#SERVERBOUND_TIME_TO_LIVE}
	COMMENT to reach the server are considered expired and log warnings on the server
	COMMENT if it contains signed message arguments. If the message takes more than
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.network.message.SignedMessage#CLIENTBOUND_TIME_TO_LIVE} to
	COMMENT reach the clients (including the time it took to reach the server), the message
	COMMENT is not considered secure anymore by the clients, and may be discarded depending
	COMMENT on the clients' options.
