CLASS net/minecraft/class_1355 net/minecraft/entity/ai/goal/GoalSelector
	COMMENT Manages a set of goals, which are competing for certain controls on the mob.
	COMMENT Multiple goals can run at the same time, so long as they are all using different controls.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A running goal will always be replaced with a goal with a <i>lower</i> priority, if
	COMMENT such a goal exists, it's competing for the same control and its
	COMMENT {@link Goal#canStart() canStart()} method returns true. (Note that some goals randomize
	COMMENT this method.)
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>If two goals have the same priority and are competing for the same control, then one
	COMMENT goal cannot replace the other if it's running. The goal selector tries to run goals in the order
	COMMENT they were added.
