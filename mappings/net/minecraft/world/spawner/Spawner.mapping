	COMMENT Spawns entities in a world.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A spawner is typically used to spawn entities within a
	COMMENT special context, such as cats in a village or wandering traders.
	COMMENT This is different from
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.world.MobSpawnerLogic the mob spawner logic}
	COMMENT which is used for {@link net.minecraft.block.SpawnerBlock the spawner block},
	COMMENT or the structure spawn conditions (such as guardians) which is defined in
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.world.gen.chunk.ChunkGenerator#getEntitySpawnList}.
	COMMENT However, cats in swamp huts are spawned in both {@link CatSpawner} and
	COMMENT the normal structure spawning.
