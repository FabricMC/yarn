		COMMENT Returns a stream consisting of this entity and its passengers in which

		COMMENT <p>Moreover, this stream guarantees that any entity only appears after
		COMMENT all its passengers have appeared in the stream. This is useful for
		COMMENT certain actions that must be applied on passengers before applying on
		COMMENT this entity.

		COMMENT @implNote The default implementation is very costly.

		COMMENT {@return the network ID of this entity}

		COMMENT <p>Compared to the {@linkplain #getUuid() UUID}, the integer network ID is

		COMMENT is not persistent across game runs. For persistent purposes such as commands
		COMMENT or game data, use the UUID.
