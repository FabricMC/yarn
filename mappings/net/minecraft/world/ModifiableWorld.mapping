	COMMENT Represents a modifiable world where block states can be changed and entities spawned.

		ARG 1 pos
		ARG 2 drop
	METHOD method_30092 setBlockState (Lnet/minecraft/class_2338;Lnet/minecraft/class_2680;II)Z
		COMMENT Updates the block state at a position, calling appropriate callbacks.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>When called on the server, the new block state is stored and propagated to clients and listeners as dictated
		COMMENT by the supplied flags. Note that calling this on the client will update the world locally, but may not see the
		COMMENT change persisted across loads. It's recommended to check whether this world is client before
		COMMENT interacting with the world in this way.</p>

		COMMENT <p>Accepted values of the flags are a bitset combination of the following:</p>
		COMMENT <ul>
		COMMENT <li>0b0000001 // 1 - PROPAGATE_CHANGE - Propagates a change event to surrounding blocks.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0000010 // 2 - NOTIFY_LISTENERS - Notifies listeners and clients who need to react when the block changes</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0000100 // 4 - NO_REDRAW - Used in conjunction with NOTIFY_LISTENERS to suppress the render pass on clients.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0001000 // 8 - REDRAW_ON_MAIN_THREAD - Forces a synchronous redraw on clients.</li>
		COMMENT <li>0b0010000 // 16 - FORCE_STATE - Bypass virtual block state changes and forces the passed state to be stored as-is.</li>
