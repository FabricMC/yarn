	COMMENT A chunk nibble array is an array of nibbles for each block position in
	COMMENT a chunk. It is most often used to store light data.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A {@index nibble} is 4 bits, storing an integer from {@code 0} to
	COMMENT {@code 15}. It takes half the space of a byte.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The nibbles are stored in an X-Z-Y major order; in the backing array,
	COMMENT the indices increases by first increasing X, then Z, and finally Y.
