CLASS net/minecraft/class_7510 net/minecraft/world/gen/feature/util/PlacedFeatureIndexer
	COMMENT A class for indexing placed features with a feature order cycle detection.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Placed features have the {@link net.minecraft.world.gen.GenerationStep.Feature
	COMMENT generation steps}, and they generate in that order. For example, if biome X registers
	COMMENT the placed feature A in the {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.world.gen.GenerationStep.Feature#UNDERGROUND_ORES} step and the
	COMMENT placed feature B and C in the {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.world.gen.GenerationStep.Feature#TOP_LAYER_MODIFICATION} step,
	COMMENT then B and C generate after A. If, then, biome Y registers B in the {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.world.gen.GenerationStep.Feature#LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS}, this will
	COMMENT cause a <strong>"feature order cycle"</strong>, because B should generate after A
	COMMENT according to the biome X, but A should generate after B according to biome Y. This
	COMMENT is wrong and causes a crash.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>In other words, "feature order cycle" occurs when <strong>placed features are
	COMMENT registered in multiple generation steps</strong>, due to e.g. reusing vanilla features.
	COMMENT To prevent this error, make sure to generate the feature in the same generation step
	COMMENT as vanilla, and if that is not possible, create a new feature.
