CLASS net/minecraft/class_6910 net/minecraft/world/gen/densityfunction/DensityFunction
	COMMENT Represents a function that maps from a block position to a density value.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>It can be defined in code or in data packs by using pre-defined function types
	COMMENT like constant values or {@code add}, which in turn use other density functions
	COMMENT to define their operands.
