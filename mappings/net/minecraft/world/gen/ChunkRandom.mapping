	FIELD field_13276 sampleCount I
	METHOD <init> (J)V
		ARG 1 seed
	METHOD method_12659 setTerrainSeed (II)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to generate the surface terrain blocks (such as grass, sand, etc.)
		COMMENT and the bedrock patterns.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Note that the terrain seed does not depend on the world seed and only gets affected by
		COMMENT chunk coordinates.</p>
		ARG 1 chunkX
		ARG 2 chunkZ
	METHOD method_12660 consume (I)V
		COMMENT Skips the provided number of calls to the randomizer.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>The skips give the effect of "scrambling" the randomizer but the output is still
		COMMENT linearly dependent. Note that since multiple calls to a linear congruential generator is
		COMMENT equivalent to another linear congruence, this method could be optimized to combine
		COMMENT the calls into one.</p>
		ARG 1 count
	METHOD method_12661 setPopulationSeed (JII)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to create population features such as decorators and animals.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This method takes in the world seed and the negative-most block coordinates of the
		COMMENT chunk. The coordinate pair provided is equivalent to (chunkX * 16, chunkZ * 16). The
		COMMENT three values are mixed together through some layers of hashing to produce the
		COMMENT population seed.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This function has been proved to be reversible through some exploitation of the underlying
		COMMENT nextLong() weaknesses. It is also important to remember that since setSeed()
		COMMENT truncates the 16 upper bits of world seed, only the 48 lowest bits affect the population
		COMMENT seed output.</p>
		ARG 1 worldSeed
		ARG 3 blockX
		ARG 4 blockZ
	METHOD method_12662 getSlimeRandom (IIJJ)Ljava/util/Random;
		ARG 0 chunkX
		ARG 1 chunkZ
		ARG 2 worldSeed
		ARG 4 scrambler
	METHOD method_12663 setCarverSeed (JII)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to generate larger features such as caves, ravines, mineshafts
		COMMENT and strongholds. It is also used to initiate structure start behaviour such as rotation.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Similar to the population seed, only the 48 lowest bits of the world seed affect the
		COMMENT output since it the upper 16 bits are truncated in the setSeed() call.</p>
		ARG 1 worldSeed
		ARG 3 chunkX
		ARG 4 chunkZ
	METHOD method_12664 setDecoratorSeed (JII)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to generate a given feature.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT The salt, in the form of {@code index + 10000 * step} assures that each feature is seeded
		COMMENT differently, making the decoration feel more random. Even though it does a good job
		COMMENT at doing so, many entropy issues arise from the salt being so small and result in
		COMMENT weird alignments between features that have an index close apart.
		ARG 1 populationSeed
			COMMENT The population seed computed in setPopulationSeed().
		ARG 3 index
			COMMENT The index of the feature in the feature list.
		ARG 4 step
			COMMENT The generation step's ordinal for this feature.
	METHOD method_12665 setRegionSeed (JIII)J
		COMMENT Seeds the randomizer to determine the start position of structure features such as
		COMMENT temples, monuments and buried treasures within a region.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>The region coordinates pair corresponds to the coordinates of the region the seeded
		COMMENT chunk lies in. For example, a swamp hut region is 32 by 32 chunks meaning that all
		COMMENT chunks that lie within that region get seeded the same way.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Similarly, the upper 16 bits of world seed also do not affect the region seed because
		COMMENT they get truncated in the setSeed() call.</p>
		ARG 1 worldSeed
		ARG 3 regionX
		ARG 4 regionZ
		ARG 5 salt
	METHOD next (I)I
		ARG 1 bound
