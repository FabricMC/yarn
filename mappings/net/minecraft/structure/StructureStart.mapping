CLASS net/minecraft/class_3449 net/minecraft/structure/StructureStart
	COMMENT A structure start is created to describe a structure that will be generated by
	COMMENT chunk generation. It contains a definition of its pieces and is associated
	COMMENT with the chunk that the structure originates from.
	FIELD field_15326 references I
		COMMENT The number of chunks that intersect the structures bounding box,
		COMMENT and have stored references to its starting chunk.
		COMMENT <p>
		COMMENT This number can be lower than the number of <em>potential</em>
		COMMENT intersecting chunks, since it is only updated when an actual reference
		COMMENT is created in such chunks (when they enter the corresponding chunk generation
		COMMENT phase).
