CLASS net/minecraft/class_4885 net/minecraft/realms/RealmsSerializable
	COMMENT A marker interface for Gson serializable pojos; the implementers make
	COMMENT sure that they have {@code SerializedName} annotation on all their
	COMMENT data fields so serialization works after obfuscation, and save/load of
	COMMENT such objects are controlled through another serializer.
