CLASS net/minecraft/class_6382 net/minecraft/client/gui/screen/narration/NarrationMessageBuilder
	COMMENT A builder for narration messages.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Narration messages consist of multiple sections known as
	COMMENT {@linkplain NarrationPart parts}. Each narration message can
	COMMENT contain only one narration per part.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>You can create a <em>submessage</em> by calling {@link #nextMessage()}.
	COMMENT Each submessage can have its own set of narrations for the different
	COMMENT narration parts.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p id="ordering">The narrations added to a message will be ordered by their part
	COMMENT first, in {@link NarrationPart}'s natural ordering. If there are multiple
	COMMENT narrations for a part added through submessages, they will be ordered earliest
	COMMENT submessage first.
