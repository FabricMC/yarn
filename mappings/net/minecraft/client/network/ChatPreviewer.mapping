CLASS net/minecraft/class_7479 net/minecraft/client/network/ChatPreviewer
	COMMENT Chat previewer manages the chat preview. Chat previewer is created per
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.client.gui.screen.ChatScreen}, so closing the chat screen and
	COMMENT reopening it would create a new chat previewer.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A <strong>query</strong> is a request to the server to send the chat message preview.
	COMMENT If the chat screen's input was previously empty, the next query sent is called
	COMMENT "initial query", since there is no {@linkplain #lastQuery last query}. This is not
	COMMENT the first query that the chat previewer sends, though, since the last query is cleared
	COMMENT whenever the chat screen's input gets empty - for example, by the player pressing Delete.
	COMMENT This distinction between the initial query and the subsequent query is important, because
	COMMENT the initial query has a shorter delay.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The response to the query can be "consumed" by calling {@link #tryConsumeResponse}.
	COMMENT If the response is still valid (i.e. the input has not changed since the query was sent),
	COMMENT consuming the response will return the response and clear it. Note that to prevent race
	COMMENT condition between the player sending the chat message and the response's arrival, responses
	COMMENT can only be consumed after the cooldown (by default, {@value #CONSUME_COOLDOWN} milliseconds)
	COMMENT has passed. It is also possible to get the response text without consuming by calling
	COMMENT {@link #getPreviewText}.
