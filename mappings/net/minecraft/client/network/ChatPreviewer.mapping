CLASS net/minecraft/class_7479 net/minecraft/client/network/ChatPreviewer
	COMMENT Chat previewer manages the chat preview. Chat previewer is created per
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.client.gui.screen.ChatScreen}, so closing the chat screen and
	COMMENT reopening it would create a new chat previewer. {@link ChatPreviewRequester}
	COMMENT handles the actual requesting.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The response to the query can be "consumed" by calling {@link #tryConsumeResponse}.
	COMMENT If the response is still valid (i.e. the input has not changed since the query was sent),
	COMMENT consuming the response will return the response and clear it. Note that to prevent race
	COMMENT condition between the player sending the chat message and the response's arrival, responses
	COMMENT can only be consumed after the cooldown (by default, {@value #CONSUME_COOLDOWN} milliseconds)
	COMMENT has passed. It is also possible to get the response text without consuming by calling
	COMMENT {@link #getPreviewText}.
