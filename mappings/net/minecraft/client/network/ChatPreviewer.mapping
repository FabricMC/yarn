CLASS net/minecraft/class_7479 net/minecraft/client/network/ChatPreviewer
	COMMENT Chat previewer manages the chat preview. Chat previewer is created per
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.client.gui.screen.ChatScreen}, so closing the chat screen and
	COMMENT reopening it would create a new chat previewer.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A <strong>query</strong> is a request to the server to send the chat message preview.
	COMMENT The previewer only sends the query if there is no query that is waiting for the response,
	COMMENT or if the last query took more than {@value #LATEST_NEXT_QUERY_DELAY} milliseconds to
	COMMENT respond. A query can be sent at most every {@value #EARLIEST_NEXT_QUERY_DELAY} milliseconds.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The response to the query can be "consumed" by calling {@link #tryConsumeResponse}.
	COMMENT If the response is still valid (i.e. the input has not changed since the query was sent),
	COMMENT consuming the response will return the response and clear it. Note that to prevent race
	COMMENT condition between the player sending the chat message and the response's arrival, responses
	COMMENT can only be consumed after the cooldown (by default, {@value #CONSUME_COOLDOWN} milliseconds)
	COMMENT has passed. It is also possible to get the response text without consuming by calling
	COMMENT {@link #getPreviewText}.
	FIELD field_39328 CONSUME_COOLDOWN J

		COMMENT arrived at the client in milliseconds. Is {@value}.
