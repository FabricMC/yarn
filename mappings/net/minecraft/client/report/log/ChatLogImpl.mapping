CLASS net/minecraft/class_7561 net/minecraft/client/report/log/ChatLogImpl
	COMMENT An implementation of {@link ChatLog} using a fixed-size array and {@code 0} as the
	COMMENT starting index. When adding a log, the index is incremented, and the entry at the
	COMMENT index is overwritten. If the index goes above the array size, the array index wraps
	COMMENT around but the entry index is still incremented.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>For example, if the size is {@code 10}, after adding the 10th item, the next index is
	COMMENT {@code 10} because the log is 0-indexed. However, the next message will be stored at
	COMMENT {@code messages[0]}. Use {@link #wrapIndex} to calculate the wrapped index.
	METHOD <init> (I)V
