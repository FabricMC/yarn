CLASS net/minecraft/class_7179 net/minecraft/client/render/entity/animation/BoneAnimation
	COMMENT An animation applied to a single bone within a timeline.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT A bone animation consists of a series of keyframes at defined points in time that
	COMMENT are then interlated between to form smooth motion.
