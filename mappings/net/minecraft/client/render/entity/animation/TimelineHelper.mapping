	METHOD method_41822 scale (DDD)Lnet/minecraft/class_1160;
		COMMENT Creates a vector for use with a scaling keyframe.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT Scaling is performed by addition, so the parameters (0,0,0) results
		COMMENT in a contraction of 1. Parameters of (1,1,1) is thus the unit vector,
		COMMENT which results in no change, and (2,2,2) would produce an expansion.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT In effect returns a vector for which all coordinates have had -1 added to them.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @return a new scale vector
		ARG 0 x
		ARG 2 y
		ARG 4 z
	METHOD method_41823 translation (FFF)Lnet/minecraft/class_1160;
		COMMENT Creates a vector for use with a translation keyframe.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT In effect simply returns a vector with the y coordinate inverted.
