CLASS net/minecraft/class_765 net/minecraft/client/render/LightmapTextureManager
	COMMENT The lightmap texture manager maintains a texture containing the RGBA overlay for each of the 16&times;16 sky and block light combinations.
	COMMENT <p>
	COMMENT Also contains some utilities to pack and unpack lightmap coordinates from sky and block light values,
	COMMENT and some lightmap coordinates constants.
	FIELD field_21528 flickerIntensity F
	FIELD field_32767 MAX_LIGHT_COORDINATE I
		COMMENT Represents the maximum lightmap coordinate, where both sky light and block light equals {@code 15}.
		COMMENT The value of this maximum lightmap coordinate is {@value}.
	FIELD field_32768 MAX_SKY_LIGHT_COORDINATE I
		COMMENT Represents the maximum sky-light-wise lightmap coordinate whose value is {@value}.
		COMMENT This is equivalent to a {@code 15} sky light and {@code 0} block light.
	FIELD field_32769 MAX_BLOCK_LIGHT_COORDINATE I
		COMMENT Represents the maximum block-light-wise lightmap coordinate whose value is {@value}.
		COMMENT This is equivalent to a {@code 0} sky light and {@code 15} block light.
