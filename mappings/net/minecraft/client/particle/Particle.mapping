CLASS net/minecraft/class_703 net/minecraft/client/particle/Particle
	COMMENT {@link Particle} is a client-side visual effect with position, velocity, collision, and additional render properties.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>
	COMMENT Each {@code Particle} is typically rendered as a camera-facing texture quad.
	COMMENT {@link net.minecraft.client.particle.SpriteBillboardParticle} provides this behavior, and most vanilla particles inherit from it.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>
	COMMENT If you would like a {@link Particle} with no direct rendering effects, inherit from {@link net.minecraft.client.particle.NoRenderParticle}.
