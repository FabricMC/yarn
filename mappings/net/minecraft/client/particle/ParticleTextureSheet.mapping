CLASS net/minecraft/class_3999 net/minecraft/client/particle/ParticleTextureSheet
	COMMENT Defines rendering setup & draw logic for particles based on their requirements for depth checking, textures, and transparency.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>
	COMMENT Each {@link net.minecraft.client.particle.Particle} returns a {@link ParticleTextureSheet} in {@link net.minecraft.client.particle.Particle#getType()}.
	COMMENT When particles are rendered, each sheet will be drawn once.
	COMMENT {@link ParticleTextureSheet#begin(BufferBuilder, TextureManager)} is first called to set up render state, and after each particle has emitted geometry, {@link ParticleTextureSheet#draw(Tessellator)} is called to draw to a target buffer.
