CLASS net/minecraft/class_7836 net/minecraft/util/math/GridBlockLengthIterator
	COMMENT An integer iterator that returns how an object should be split up in a grid. A grid is
	COMMENT composed of one or more blocks, A block is either a row or a column. This iterator
	COMMENT calculates the length of a side of a block, given the number of occupied blocks and
	COMMENT the total length of the object. This tries to make the blocks' length roughly equal.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Example: suppose we have an object with length {@code 160} and {@code 16} available
	COMMENT blocks. Since {@code 160} is divisible by {@code 16}, this iterator outputs {@code 160 / 16}
	COMMENT - that is, {@code 16} - {@code 16} times.
	COMMENT If there are {@code 14} available blocks, the block length is either {@code 11} ({@code
	COMMENT 160 / 14}) or {@code 12} ({@code 160 / 14 + 1}). There are {@code 6} ({@code 160 - 11 * 14})
	COMMENT blocks with length {@code 12} and {@code 8} ({@code 14 - 6}) blocks with length {@code 11}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT @implNote The exact implementation is as follows: each time the next length is requested,
	COMMENT it accumulates the remainder length, and when the accumulated value is equal to or above
	COMMENT the number of occupied blocks, it subtracts that number from the accumulated value and
	COMMENT returns {@code normalBlockLength + 1}. It otherwise returns {@link #normalBlockLength}.
