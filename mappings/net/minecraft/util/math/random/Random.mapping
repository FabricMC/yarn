	COMMENT A reimplementation of {@link java.util.Random}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>There are four built-in implementations, three based on the classic Java algorithm
	COMMENT and one using Xoroshiro128++ algorithm.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <ul>
	COMMENT <li>{@link LocalRandom}: Silently breaks when used concurrently. Based on
	COMMENT {@link java.util.Random}.</li>
	COMMENT <li>{@link CheckedRandom}: Throws when used concurrently. Based on
	COMMENT {@link java.util.Random}.</li>
	COMMENT <li>{@link ThreadSafeRandom}: Blocks the thread when used concurrently. Based on
	COMMENT {@link java.util.Random}.</li>
	COMMENT <li>{@link Xoroshiro128PlusPlusRandom}: Silently breaks when used concurrently.
	COMMENT Implements the Xoroshiro128++ algorithm.</li>
	COMMENT </ul>

	COMMENT @implNote Note that due to MC-239059, this is not an exact reimplementation of
	COMMENT the Java random number generator algorithm.
