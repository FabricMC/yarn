CLASS net/minecraft/class_6880 net/minecraft/util/registry/RegistryEntry
	COMMENT An object holding a value that can be registered in a registry. In most cases, the
	COMMENT value is already registered in a registry ("reference entry"), hence the name;
	COMMENT however, it is possible to create a registry entry by direct reference
	COMMENT ("direct entry"). This is useful for data packs, as they can define
	COMMENT one-time use values directly without having to register them every time.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Registry entries do not define {@code equals} method. Instead, compare the result
	COMMENT of {@link #getKeyOrValue}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Reference registry entries also hold their {@linkplain TagKey tags}. For more
	COMMENT information on type-specific behaviors, including "intrusive" and "stand-alone"
	COMMENT reference registry entries, see the respective class documentations.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A registry entry is sometimes referred to as a "holder" in error messages.

	CLASS class_6881 Direct
		COMMENT A direct registry entry holds the value directly. The value does not have to be
		COMMENT registered in a registry. Therefore, they receive no ID or registry key, and they
		COMMENT cannot be tagged.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This is most often used in data packs to inline one-time use values directly.
	CLASS class_6882 Type
		COMMENT The types of registry entries.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see RegistryEntry
	CLASS class_6883 Reference
		COMMENT A reference registry entry holds the value by reference. The value is previously
		COMMENT registered in a registry, so they can be referred to by their registry keys.
		COMMENT This object also holds the entry's tags.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>There are two types of reference registry entries.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <ul>
		COMMENT <li><strong>Stand-alone</strong> registry entries are first instantiated by its key,
		COMMENT and the value is set when registering the value. This is used by most of the registries.</li>
		COMMENT <li><strong>Intrusive</strong> registry entries are registry entries tied to a specific
		COMMENT registerable object at instantiation time. When instantiating those, it promises
		COMMENT that the object is later registered - which, if broken, will result in a crash.
		COMMENT This is used for {@link #BLOCK}, {@link #ITEM}, {@link #FLUID}, {@link #ENTITY_TYPE},
		COMMENT and {@link #GAME_EVENT} registries. This type exists for historical reasons and is
		COMMENT deprecated.</li>
		COMMENT </ul>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Therefore, it is very important to construct any intrusive-entry type object
		COMMENT and register at the same time. For example, a mod that conditionally registers an
		COMMENT {@link Item} has to create an instance only if the condition is met. (See {@link Registry}
		COMMENT for a code example.)
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>When a reference registry entry is first instantiated, it only has either the key
		COMMENT or the value (depending on the type). They are later filled when registering the
		COMMENT entry at {@link #setKeyAndValue}. Attempting to call methods before those fields are filled
		COMMENT can cause a crash. Note that if you are just getting the entry from a registry, this
		COMMENT should not be a problem.
