	COMMENT Utilities to perform a topological sort.
	METHOD method_37951 sort (Ljava/util/Map;Ljava/util/Set;Ljava/util/Set;Ljava/util/function/Consumer;Ljava/lang/Object;)Z
		COMMENT Performs a topological sort recursively through a reverse DFS. The
		COMMENT results are passed to the consumer in reverse order, where each element
		COMMENT is guaranteed to be passed before any of its predecessors (dependencies).
		COMMENT When multiple orders are valid, the results will first trace along earlier
		COMMENT returned successors in the successor set iteration for each element.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @return {@code true} if the sort ends up in a loop, or {@code false} for
		COMMENT a successful sort
		ARG 0 successors
			COMMENT the map holding information on successor (dependents) of each element
		ARG 1 visited
			COMMENT elements that already iterated all their successors
		ARG 2 visiting
			COMMENT elements that are still iterating their successors
		ARG 3 reversedOrderConsumer
			COMMENT accepts sorted results in reverse order; each element is passed only
			COMMENT before any of its predecessors (dependencies) is, or after all its
			COMMENT successors (dependents) are passed
		ARG 4 now
			COMMENT the starting or current element
