CLASS net/minecraft/class_5996 net/minecraft/util/annotation/Debug
	COMMENT An annotation, mostly on side-effect-free methods.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Most methods annotated are getters that don't cause side-effects. Some of
	COMMENT those methods also may execute dry-runs.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>However, it is present on {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.entity.passive.BeeEntity.MoveToHiveGoal}, and its purpose in that
	COMMENT case is not yet clear.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This annotation has class retention and can be applied to a wide range of
	COMMENT targets.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This annotation is not {@link java.lang.annotation.Documented}, and hence
	COMMENT will not appear in the generated javadoc for annotated elements.
