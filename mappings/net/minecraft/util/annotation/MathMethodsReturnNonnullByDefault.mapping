	COMMENT values unless nullability is specified with a separate annotation.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>While this annotation is meant to be a package/class annotation, it can
	COMMENT be applied to anything as it does not restrict its targets.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This is pretty much identical to {@link MethodsReturnNonnullByDefault}, but
	COMMENT this is only used by the package info for a few math classes.
