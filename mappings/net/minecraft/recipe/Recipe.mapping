CLASS net/minecraft/class_1860 net/minecraft/recipe/Recipe
	COMMENT A recipe is an arrangement of items in an inventory that can
	COMMENT yield a product item stack. <strong>Recipes are not used on the client side</strong>;
	COMMENT the server syncs to the client a {@link RecipeDisplayEntry},
	COMMENT which is used instead.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Recipes are loaded by and stored in the {@link ServerRecipeManager}. They
	COMMENT are part of the server's data packs. Hence, recipes should not be stored,
	COMMENT as they may become obsolete after reloads.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>{@link RecipeEntry} is a pair of the recipe and its ID ({@linkplain
	COMMENT net.minecraft.registry.RegistryKey a registry key}). The ID can be used to
	COMMENT refer to recipes in saved data. However, the client does not receive the ID of
	COMMENT recipes.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A few of the methods in this class are dedicated to crafting recipes
	COMMENT or recipe books. Users can have stub implementations if they do not use
	COMMENT those functionalities.
