CLASS net/minecraft/class_1865 net/minecraft/recipe/RecipeSerializer
	COMMENT The recipe serializer controls the serialization and deserialization of
	COMMENT recipe content. The caller should handle the serialization of recipes' IDs.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Even though they are referred to by the {@code type} field in recipe
	COMMENT JSON format, they are stored in a registry with key
	COMMENT {@code minecraft:root/minecraft:recipe_serializer}, and is hence named.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>If a recipe's serializer exists only on the server but not on the
	COMMENT client, the client will disconnect upon receiving the recipe; if a
	COMMENT recipe JSON intended for an absent recipe serializer is read, it is
	COMMENT skipped.
