CLASS net/minecraft/class_2343 net/minecraft/block/BlockEntityProvider
	COMMENT A block with a {@link BlockEntity}. If a block has a corresponding block entity,
	COMMENT it must implement this interface. Multiple blocks can share a block entity type.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The {@link #createBlockEntity} method is responsible for creating an instance
	COMMENT of your block entity; no other code should instantiate it.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>See the documentation of {@link BlockEntity} for more information on what a
	COMMENT block entity is. See the documentation of {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.block.entity.BlockEntityType} for how to create a block entity type.

	METHOD method_10123 createBlockEntity (Lnet/minecraft/class_2338;Lnet/minecraft/class_2680;)Lnet/minecraft/class_2586;
		COMMENT {@return a new block entity instance}
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>For example:
		COMMENT <pre>{@code
		COMMENT @Override
		COMMENT public BlockEntity createBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
		COMMENT   return new MyBlockEntity(pos, state);
		COMMENT }
		COMMENT }</pre>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @implNote While this is marked as nullable, in practice this should never return
		COMMENT {@code null}. {@link PistonExtensionBlock} is the only block in vanilla that
		COMMENT returns {@code null} inside the implementation.
		ARG 1 pos
		ARG 2 state
	METHOD method_31645 getTicker (Lnet/minecraft/class_1937;Lnet/minecraft/class_2680;Lnet/minecraft/class_2591;)Lnet/minecraft/class_5558;
		COMMENT {@return the "ticker" for the block's block entity, or {@code null} if
		COMMENT the block entity does not need to be ticked}
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Ticker is a functional interface called every tick to tick the block entity
		COMMENT on both the client and the server.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Tickers should validate that the passed {@code type} is the one this block expects,
		COMMENT and return {@code null} if it isn't. This is to prevent crashes in rare cases where a
		COMMENT mismatch occurs between the position's block and block entity. {@link
		COMMENT BlockWithEntity#validateTicker} can be used to implement the check.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Example:
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <pre>{@code
		COMMENT public <T extends BlockEntity> BlockEntityTicker<T> getTicker(World world, BlockState state, BlockEntityType<T> type) {
		COMMENT   if (type != YourMod.MY_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE) return null;
		COMMENT   // This should be a static method usable as a BlockEntityTicker.
		COMMENT   return YourBlockEntity::tick;
		COMMENT }
		COMMENT }</pre>
		ARG 1 world
		ARG 2 state
		ARG 3 type
	METHOD method_32896 getGameEventListener (Lnet/minecraft/class_3218;Lnet/minecraft/class_2586;)Lnet/minecraft/class_5714;
		COMMENT {@return the game event listener for the block's block entity,
		COMMENT or {@code null} if the block entity does not listen to game events}
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Listeners should validate that the passed {@code blockEntity} is the block entity
		COMMENT for this block, and return {@code null} if it isn't. This is to prevent crashes in
		COMMENT rare cases where a mismatch occurs between the position's block and block entity.
		ARG 1 world
		ARG 2 blockEntity
