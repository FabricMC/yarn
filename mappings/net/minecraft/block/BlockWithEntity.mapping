CLASS net/minecraft/class_2237 net/minecraft/block/BlockWithEntity
	COMMENT A convenience class for a block with a {@link net.minecraft.block.entity.BlockEntity}.
	COMMENT While blocks with block entity only have to implement {@link BlockEntityProvider}
	COMMENT and do not have to subclass this, it overrides several methods to delegate its logic
	COMMENT to the block entity. However, <strong>it is generally easier to just implement
	COMMENT {@link BlockEntityProvider}</strong>.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p><strong>Subclasses must override {@link #getRenderType}</strong> to render the
	COMMENT block entity. By default, all block entities are rendered invisible, which is not
	COMMENT intended in most, if not all, cases.
