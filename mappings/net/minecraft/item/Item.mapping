CLASS net/minecraft/class_1792 net/minecraft/item/Item
	COMMENT An item usable by players and other entities.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Like {@link Block}, this class handles logics for a type of item, and does not
	COMMENT hold any data. Any data about a particular stack of item in a world, such as item count,
	COMMENT is held by an {@link ItemStack} which represents a stack of specific item. Therefore,
	COMMENT there is one - and only one - instance of Item for one item (like apples, oak planks, etc),
	COMMENT while there can be infinite amounts of {@link ItemStack} instances. This also means that
	COMMENT items themselves cannot hold NBT data. To append item stacks with NBT data to the
	COMMENT creative inventory, override {@link #appendStacks}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Items with no custom behavior, like diamonds, can call the constructor of Item
	COMMENT directly. If a custom behavior is needed, this should be subclassed. Items also have
	COMMENT to be registered in the {@link net.minecraft.util.registry.Registry#ITEM} registry.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Many methods of this class are called on both the logical client and logical server,
	COMMENT so take caution when using those methods. The logical side can be checked using
	COMMENT {@link World#isClient}. See also <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:side">
	COMMENT the Fabric Wiki article</a>. It is also important that methods that take {@link LivingEntity}
	COMMENT as an argument can be called by non-players (such as foxes eating food), which causes
	COMMENT a crash if the code performs unchecked casting.
