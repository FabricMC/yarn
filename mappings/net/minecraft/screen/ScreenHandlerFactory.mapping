CLASS net/minecraft/class_1270 net/minecraft/screen/ScreenHandlerFactory
	COMMENT A functional interface to create a new screen handler (menu) on the server.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This interface itself is not used directly. Instead, the subinterface
	COMMENT {@link NamedScreenHandlerFactory} is passed to {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.entity.player.PlayerEntity#openHandledScreen}. In vanilla,
	COMMENT block entity instances implement that interface, allowing them to be passed.
	COMMENT {@link SimpleNamedScreenHandlerFactory} is a screen handler factory implementation
	COMMENT for use cases that do not involve a block entity.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The factory should create a new instance of a screen handler with the server-side
	COMMENT constructor (one that takes inventories, etc). If the screen handler requires
	COMMENT a property delegate or a context, create an instance and pass it here.
