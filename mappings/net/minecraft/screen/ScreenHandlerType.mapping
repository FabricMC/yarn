CLASS net/minecraft/class_3917 net/minecraft/screen/ScreenHandlerType
	COMMENT Screen handler type is used to create screen handlers on the client.
	COMMENT It is a holder object holding a factory (usually a reference to the constructor).
	COMMENT They are registered in the registry under {@link
	COMMENT net.minecraft.registry.Registries#SCREEN_HANDLER}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>Technically speaking, screen handlers do not have to register screen handler
	COMMENT types. However, such screen handlers are practically useless as they cannot be
	COMMENT opened server-side using conventional methods.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT @apiNote Screen handler types should not be used to create a new screen handler
	COMMENT on the server. See {@link ScreenHandlerFactory} for server-side creation.
